# Sol-Ark Cloud Integration

This is a simple integration that lets you configure your Sol-Ark Cloud
credentials and then will export that data as sensors.

**This integration is in no way affiliated with the real Sol-Ark company
or its excellent equipment.**

## Known Issues

1. If you have more than 100 plants, we won't get more than that.
2. It's not robustly tested yet.
